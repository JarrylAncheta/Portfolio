  My name is Jarryl Ancheta and I am currently a digital media student in San Jose State University. As an artist, I look after peace of mind and gaining value through each of my artwork. Self-expression is my ultimate goal. I strive to be experimental and have a willingness to try anything. I dissect social practices of meaning-making in an attempt to open up new interpretations of reality.

My projects carry a lesson for the viewers to value. My artwork functions as a way for the audience to generate new perspectives. Primarily, I use Adobe Programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator to create my projects. I incorporate a lot of found images. Whenever I have trouble thinking of ideas, I browse other digital artwork that interests me then I improvise and use my self-expression as a catalyst.
