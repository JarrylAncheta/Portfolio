  </b><br>My name is Jarryl Ancheta and I am currently a digital media student in San Jose State University. As an artist, I look after peace of mind and gaining value through each of my artwork. Self-expression is my ultimate goal. I strive to be experimental and have a willingness to try anything. I dissect social practices of meaning-making in an attempt to open up new interpretations of reality.

My projects carry a lesson for the viewers to value. My artwork functions as a way for the audience to generate new perspectives. Primarily, I use Adobe Programs such as Photoshop and Illustrator to create my projects. I incorporate a lot of found images. Whenever I have trouble thinking of ideas, I browse other digital artwork that interests me then I improvise and use my self-expression as a catalyst.

  </b><br> Most of my projects carry a lesson for the viewers to value. My pieces of artwork serve for different purposes such as public service announcements, time capsules, learning of different cultures, etc. My project, "Cultural Influence of the Fashion Industry" demonstrates my work as an artist because it includes influence from around the world to display the power of the fashion towards everyday-life and politics. My projects function as a way for the audience to generate new perspectives. Primarily, I use Adobe Programs such as After Effects and Premiere Pro to create my projects. I incorporate a lot of found footage. Whenever I have trouble thinking of ideas, I browse other digital artwork that interests me then I improvise and use my self-expression as a catalyst.
