  </b><br>My name is Jarryl Ancheta and I am currently a digital media student in San Jose State University. As an artist, I look after peace of mind and gaining value through each of my artwork. Self-expression is my ultimate goal. I strive to be experimental and have a willingness to try anything. I dissect social practices of meaning-making in an attempt to open up new interpretations of reality. Exploring subjects as diverse as fashion, 80s technology, human species my works veer between straightforward attempts to remove the veil of autonomy from signifiers, and moments of semiotic play meant to inject elements of confusion and interest.

My individual projects usually find their locus in present-day. In one of my pieces "Humans: The Most Invasive Species," I target how careless humans beings can be towards the precious Earth. It is ironic how throughout the history of mankind humans have constantly caused an astronomical amount of animal species to become extinct through simply killing/hunting once they perceive a certain species a threat to the environment. Often they start as sources for the collection of a wide range of materials including objects, image, and video. As these elements are worked over and treated, the originating text becomes more of a framework for understanding and reimagining the specific social interests and ideologies that shape the act of interpretation itself.<br><br>

  </b><br> Most of my projects carry a lesson for the viewers to value. My pieces of artwork serve for different purposes such as public service announcements, time capsules, learning of different cultures, etc. My project, "Cultural Influence of the Fashion Industry" demonstrates my work as an artist because it includes influence from around the world to display the power of the fashion towards everyday-life and politics. My projects function as a way for the audience to generate new perspectives. Primarily, I use Adobe Programs such as After Effects and Premiere Pro to create my projects. I incorporate a lot of found footage. Whenever I have trouble thinking of ideas, I browse other digital artwork that interests me then I improvise and use my self-expression as a catalyst.
