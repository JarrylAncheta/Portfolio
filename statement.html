  My name is Jarryl Ancheta and I am a digital media student at San Jose State University. As an artist, I look after peace of mind and gaining value through my artwork. Self-expression is my ultimate goal. I strive to be experimental and have a willingness to try anything. I dissect social practices of meaning-making in an attempt to open up new interpretations of reality. My projects carry a lesson for the viewers to value and as a way for the audience to generate new perspectives. Primarily, I use Adobe Programs such as Photoshop, Illustrator to create digital art. I use Github to code any interactive projects and websites. I incorporate a wide variety of found images and videos. Whenever I have trouble thinking of ideas, I browse other digital artwork that interests me then I improvise and use my self-expression as a catalyst.
