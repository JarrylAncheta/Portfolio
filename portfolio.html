     <p class="big"> My interactive project features a wave-like effect which endlessly swirls in motion. Black background is utilized to emphasize the vibrant blue color. As the mouse is moved, particles create wave effects. The project is meant to sooth the viewers and help them escape reality into a whole new dimension.
