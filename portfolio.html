     <p class="big">  For this project, I went for a dark background so it would place emphasis on the contrasting warm and cool colors. From Adobe Illustrator, I was able to create the gradient.</p>

     <p>  Modern fashion has grown bigger in the last 20-30 years. Fashion has become a global phenomenon in which different cultures come together to appreciate one's style. My intetion for this piece was to demonstrate the power of the fashion industry in political advertising. For example, Balenciaga has utilized its platform to expand political knowledge on the youth.</p>

  </h3><i>GT-R Scribble Effect Cinematic</i>, Final Project Digital Video, 1:27, 2019</h3>
     <p>   The Nissan GT-R is arguably known to be the face of Japanese domestic motors. To satisfy my passion for cars, I chose to honor the Nissan GT-R and give it its credit for bringing car enthusiasts together. The car community is "often seen as a space where men can be men, and in many instances it provides one of the few opportunities for men to forge emotional ties with other men, often across generations."  In terms of the editing, I was inspired by one of today's famous musical video editors named Cole Bennett and his group Lyrical Lemonade. My intention was to get a cartoon effect combined with a rapid Need for Speed like pace.
