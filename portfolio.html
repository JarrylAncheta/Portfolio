     <p class="big">"Circle of Gradience" by Jarryl Ancheta. For this project, I went for a dark background so it would place emphasis on the contrasting warm and cool colors. From Adobe Illustrator, I was able to create the gradient.

     <p class="big"> "Wavy" by Jarryl Ancheta. For this project, I went for a simplistic background so it would focus the attention on the wave gradient particle. The particle consists of different lines of light blue and red, contrasting both warm and cool colors.

     <p class="big"> "Be Water" by Jarryl Ancheta. My interactive project features a wave-like effect which endlessly swirls in motion. Black background is utilized to emphasize the vibrant blue color. As the mouse is moved, particles create wave effects. The project is meant to sooth the viewers and help them escape reality into a whole new dimension.

     <p> "Distorted Nature" by Jarryl Ancheta. This image was edited in Photoshop using several methods of color adjustments, wave effect, and halftone patterns. The aesthetic is to give a time capsule in time.

  <img src="MyImages/ButterflyExercise.jpg" width="680" height="500">
     <p class="big"> "Fly Like a Butterfly" by Jarryl Ancheta. By using layering masks in Photoshop, this project consists of different gradient colors to give the image a military camouflage like aesthetic.

     <p class="big"> "Roaring 2020's" by Jarryl Ancheta. My hyper reality project encapsulates a view of Las Vegas to portray its lively nightlife using a tracker. The big text of "the city never sleeps" represents its lively atmosphere during the night time.

<div id="portfolio-item8">
  <img src="MyImages/Anxiety.jpg" width="510" height="420">
     <p class="big"> "My overall concept was to have a hollow head that would represent the thoughts and emotions of a person dealing with anxiety. The reason for the warped background is to portray the feeling of distress that goes through a person’s mind whether it's stress or rejection. Using Photoshop, I warped the background and created a distorted image to portray the feeling of stress and discomfort. The detached face acts as a mask that hides one’s personal insecurities. Whether it's shyness or fear of rejection in social situations, I want to be able to make the viewers get an outside perspective of their anxieties. The text inside the figures’ head says “Will they accept me?” “Shy,” “Pressure,” and “What if?” are questions and traits for the viewers to reply and connect to.

  <img src="MyImages/Portrait.jpg" width="450" height="580"   >
     <p class="big"> "Self-portrait" by Jarryl Ancheta. The cartoon aesthetic of this portrait mixed with different color tones was inspired by Andy Warhol's portraits.

<div id="portfolio-item10">
  <img src="MyImages/DigitalMediaProject.jpg" width="750" height="880"   >
     <p class="big"> "Distortion" by Jarryl Ancheta. In this final project, I decided to make a collage of four different portraits with glitch effects. It features some of the most
influential musical arts of the decade. At the bottom of the art piece consists of a text that 
says “glitch” which was created using the liquify tool. I mainly 
used Photoshop using various techniques of masking, double
exposure, and color balancing. I wanted to maintain a simplistic 
background so the attention would be focused on the 
distorted images and text.
