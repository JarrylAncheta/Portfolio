     <p>  Modern fashion has grown bigger in the last 20-30 years. Fashion has become a global phenomenon in which different cultures come together to appreciate one's style. My intetion for this piece was to demonstrate the power of the fashion industry in political advertising. For example, Balenciaga has utilized its platform to expand political knowledge on the youth.</p>

      </h3><i>Humans: Most Invasive Species PSA</i>, Project 2 Digital Video, 2:11, 2019</h3>
     <p>This digital video displays the harsh environmental effects of humans. Humans are ironically the most invasive species. I decided to use depressing background audio and visual imagery of reality in order to help viewers take action.</p>

  </h3><i>Retro Time Capsule</i>, 2019</h3>
     <p>   The overall theme behind my Project 3 Website is to incorporate a distorted vintage look. My retro wave design is what I explored. I figured that with the abundance of high quality net art, it would only be right to create a retro-based look in order to be different. I felt that creating artwork based on past generations like the 80s would attract more people because it is different from today's art. It also allows viewers, specifically millennials to reminisce on the digital art of the late 20th century. My intention for my website is to bring variety into the digital realm with outdated gadgets and computer browsers.

  </h3><i>GT-R Scribble Effect Cinematic</i>, Final Project Digital Video, 1:27, 2019</h3>
     <p>   The Nissan GT-R is arguably known to be the face of Japanese domestic motors. To satisfy my passion for cars, I chose to honor the Nissan GT-R and give it its credit for bringing car enthusiasts together. The car community is "often seen as a space where men can be men, and in many instances it provides one of the few opportunities for men to forge emotional ties with other men, often across generations."  In terms of the editing, I was inspired by one of today's famous musical video editors named Cole Bennett and his group Lyrical Lemonade. My intention was to get a cartoon effect combined with a rapid Need for Speed like pace.
